# A) I watched a Movie today
# B) I sat on the couch today


# P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)

# The probability that I watched a Movie today given that I sat on the couch today EQUALS
# The probability that I sat on the couch today given that I watched a movie today TIMES
# the probability that I watched a movie today DIVIDED BY
# the probability that I sat on the couch today

# i've seen the lego movie 10 times in the past 2 months
P(A) = P(I watched The Lego Movie today) = 10 / 60, or ~0.17
# I sat on my couch at least once on every other day during the past 2 months.
P(B) = P(I sat on the couch today) = (60 - 14) / 60, or ~0.76
# I've seen The Lego Movie 10 times and 4 of those times have been on a plane. I think it's pretty safe to assume the rest of those times I was seated comfortably in my living room. So given that I've had 46 days of couchtime in the past 2 months, we can say that I watched The Lego Movie from my couch 6 / 10 times in the past 2 months
P(B|A) = P(I sat on the couch given that I watched The Lego Movie) = 6 / 10 = 0.60


# use bayes theorem to get:
P(I watched The Lego Movie given that I sat on the couch) = 0.13
